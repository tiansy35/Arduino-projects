## Project 1  Position Sensing of an Object on Cantilevers

The project precicely sensed the position of a moving object on a cantilever. Different positions of the object caused slightly different deformation of the cantilever, and it is measured by strain gauges and a bridge circuit. The "motor" code caliberates the sensors by controling a step moter to accurately drive the object to different locations on the cantilever.
