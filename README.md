## Project 1  Position Sensing of an Object on Cantilevers

The project precisely sensed the position of a moving object on a cantilever. Different positions of the object caused slightly different deformation of the cantilever, and it is measured by strain gauges and a bridge circuit. The system looks like [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OnwcsgjhRVHfMfDv9uaYfL2xoI8uK0y3/view?usp=sharing). While caliberating the sensors, we wrote the "motor" code to control a step motor which accurately drives the object to different locations on the cantilever through a ball screw structure.
